## Aleut Federal Context — Federal-User Research Synthesis

When synthesizing research with federal users:

- **PRA compliance** — research that collects identical information from 10 or more members of the public requires OMB clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act unless an exception applies. Internal federal-employee research and contractor-only research is typically exempt; verify before proceeding.
- **Privacy / PII** — research data containing PII handled per the Privacy Act and the agency's Privacy Impact Assessment.
- **CUI handling** — research notes referencing CUI live in authorized environments.
- **Federal-employee identifiability** — direct quotes attributed to identifiable federal employees can create issues (5 C.F.R. § 2635 / agency policy on endorsements). Aggregate / anonymize.
- **Distribution** — synthesis distributed to the customer is a CDRL deliverable if specified; format per the DID.

Themes should map back to PWS / SOO objectives the contract is performing against.

Synthesize user research data into actionable insights. See the **user-research** skill for research methods, interview guides, and analysis frameworks.

### Insights → Opportunities

| Insight | Opportunity | Impact | Effort |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [What we learned] | [What we could do] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |

### User Segments Identified
| Segment | Characteristics | Needs | Size |
|---------|----------------|-------|------|
| [Name] | [Description] | [Key needs] | [Rough %] |

### Recommendations
1. **[High priority]** — [Why, based on which findings]
2. **[Medium priority]** — [Why]
3. **[Lower priority]** — [Why]

### Questions for Further Research
- [What we still don't know]

### Methodology Notes
[How the research was conducted, any limitations or biases to note]

## If Connectors Available

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Pull support tickets, feature requests, and NPS responses to supplement research data
- Cross-reference themes with real user complaints and requests

If **~~product analytics** is connected:
- Validate qualitative findings with usage data and behavioral metrics
- Quantify the impact of identified pain points

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for prior research studies and findings to compare against
- Publish the synthesis to your research repository

## Tips

1. **Include raw quotes** — Direct participant quotes make insights credible and memorable.
2. **Separate observations from interpretations** — "5 of 8 users clicked the wrong button" is an observation. "The button placement is confusing" is an interpretation.
3. **Quantify where possible** — "Most users" is vague. "7 of 10 users" is specific.
